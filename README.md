## What is QeamerWRT?

QeamerWRT is a personal firmware project built on top of **Asuswrt-Merlin 384.13_10** — the last community-maintained release for the RT-AC87U. The router reached end-of-life in 2020, but its userspace security components (TLS, DNS, SSH) can be modernised through careful backporting.

**Owner / maintainer:** Kent "Qeamer" Nygjerdet  
**Target hardware:** RT-AC87U · BCM4709 · ARMv7 32-bit · separate Quantenna 5 GHz radio

### It is
- Updated internet-facing components: TLS / DNS / SSH / curl
- Closed attack surface: no WAN admin, no UPnP, no WPS
- Strict firewall with IPSet blocklists and DDoS mitigation
- Encrypted DNS (DNS-over-TLS + DNSSEC)
- QeamerWRT branding baked into UI, login page and SSH banner

### It is not
- A new kernel — the closed Broadcom `wl.ko` driver locks the kernel version
- WPA3 — requires driver support that cannot be added
- A fix for the Quantenna 5 GHz radio — closed firmware, no source available
- A replacement for a supported 2025+ router on the WAN edge long-term

## Security improvements

| Component | From | To | CVEs closed |
|-----------|------|----|-------------|
| **dnsmasq** | 2.81 | ≥ 2.90 | CVE-2020-25681…25687 (DNSpooq) |
| **OpenSSL** | 1.0.2u (EOL) | 1.1.1w | CVE-2022-0778, CVE-2021-3711, CVE-2021-3712, CVE-2023-0286 |
| **Dropbear** | 2020.80 | ≥ 2022.83 | CVE-2021-36369 + hardened cipher list |
| **curl** | ~7.66 | 8.x | Dozens of URL/TLS CVEs (2020–2026) |
| **BusyBox** | old | newer stable | CVE-2021-42373…42386, CVE-2022-28391 |
| **nettle** | old | 3.10.x | CVE-2021-3580 |
| **zlib** | old | ≥ 1.2.12 | CVE-2022-37434 |
| **CA bundle** | stale | fresh Mozilla bundle | Removes expired/revoked root CAs |

**Firewall / DNS hardening baked in:**
- Default-drop on all unsolicited WAN traffic
- SYN cookies, rp_filter, anti-bogon, rate-limited ICMP
- DNS-over-TLS (stubby → Quad9), DNSSEC validation, DNS rebind protection
- IPSet blocklists (botnets, scanners, malicious IPs) loaded at boot

## Phase plan

| Phase | Deliverable | Brick risk |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **0** | Add-on hardening on stock firmware (Skynet, Diversion, stubby via `amtm`) — do this tonight | None |
| **1** | Build environment + unmodified image that compiles and boots | Low–medium |
| **2** | QeamerWRT branding + UI theme baked into image | Low |
| **3** | Firewall + DDoS + DNS hardening baked in | Medium |
| **4** | Backport TLS / DNS / SSH / curl userspace components | Medium |
| **5** | Freeze QeamerWRT 1.0, publish GPL source | — |

> **Start with Phase 0.** It delivers ~80% of the security benefit tonight, with zero brick risk, on the firmware you already have. Build Phase 1+ as the ownership/hobby project alongside it.

---

## Quick start — Phase 0 (stock firmware, no build needed)

SSH into the router and run:

```bash
# Install amtm (if not present)
curl -Os https://raw.githubusercontent.com/decoderman/amtm/master/amtm
sh amtm

# From the amtm menu install:
# sk  →  Skynet   (IPSet firewall + DDoS + blocklists)
# di  →  Diversion (DNS ad/malware blocking)
# st  →  stubby    (DNS-over-TLS)
```

Then in the router web UI:
- Administration → System → Disable Telnet, enable HTTPS-only
- WAN → Disable UPnP, NAT-PMP
- Wireless → Disable WPS
- Administration → System → Disable "Enable web access from WAN"

---

## Quick start — Phase 1 (build environment)

See [`guides/phase1-build.md`](guides/phase1-build.md) for the full walkthrough. Short version:

```bash
# Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 VM recommended
git clone https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin.git
cd asuswrt-merlin
git checkout 384.13

sudo apt install -y build-essential libtool-bin autoconf automake \
  bison flex g++ gawk gengetopt gettext git gperf nano \
  libncurses5-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev unzip uuid-dev xsltproc cmake

cd release/src-rt-6.x.4708
make rt-ac87u 2>&1 | tee ~/build-ac87u.log
```

> ⚠️ Flash nothing until you have a USB-TTL serial cable connected and CFE/TFTP recovery tested. Read the fase 1 document fully first.
